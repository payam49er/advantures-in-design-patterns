#Iterator Pattern
In general, this pattern facilitates the process of iterating a data structure. an object (in .Net a method) that facilitates the traversal of a data
structure. 
Traversal is a core functionality of various data structures. 
An iterator has two have two features:
1. It keeps a reference to the current element
2. Knows how to move to a different element in the collection

Iterator is an implicit construct. In DotNet, a state machine is created aroudn the yeild return statements.
